## why learning CRIU
### CRIU is a fantastic place to learn program with linux using c. 
* You have to know linux related details as you have to checkpoint a running process.
* You can learn using protobuf to serialize and deserialize a lot of process states when check and restore a running process
* During the above process, you will use plenty of linux kernel data structure, such as list, rbtree, in user space. This will smooth your linux kernel learning curve significantly.
